DESCRIPTION
-----------

Fast Sparse Grids (or FastSG) is a free collection of fast C++ routines 
for representing and evaluating higher-dimensional functions using the 
sparse grid technique. It includes routines optimized with respect to 
both memory consumption and execution time. FastSG is in general faster 
that other publically-available sparse grid implementations. To achieve
this performance, FastSG uses a new data structure based on a bijection
that maps a higer-dimensional sparse grid to a set of consecutive 
integers, thus minimizing the memory consumption.

More information about the data structure and the algorithms built on 
top of it can be found in the following paper:

Pfl√ºger: "Compact Data Structure and Scalable Algorithms for the Sparse
Grid Technique", PPoPP, Feb. 2011.
